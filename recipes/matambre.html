    <li>1 c milk</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>For the sauce</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>1 spoon olive oils</li>
    <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
    <li>1 large clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 spoon oregano</li>
    <li>1 spoon paprika</li>
    <li>1/4 spoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 spoon salt</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
   <ul>
        <li>4 oz mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1-2 small tomatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>Roasted red pepper</li>
        <li>Sliced deli ham</li>
        <li>Green olives</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
   </ul>
    
   </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place the pounded steak into a large baking dish. Season the steak with salt and pepper and cover it with milk. (Add a little extra milk if the steak is not completely covered.)</li>
    <li>Cover the dish and refrigerate for 8-12 hours.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the minced onion and garlic, and saute until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the tomatoes, oregano, paprika, chile flakes, and salt. Bring the sauce to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened, 10-12 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the marinating meat from the refrigerator 1 hour before you want to grill it, to let it come to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Preheat grill to a medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Drain the milk from the steak, discarding the milk. Pat the steak dry.</li>
    <li>Place the steak on your preheated grill and grill the first side for 5-7 minutes, uncovered.</li>
    <li>Flip the flank steak.</li>
    <li>Spread the cooked side with your prepared pizza sauce. Spread the mozzarella cheese over the sauce, and top with the tomatoes (and other toppings if desired).</li>
    <li>Cover the grill and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, until the steak is done and the cheese has melted.
    </li>
    <li>Remove the steak from the grill and let it stand for 5 minutes before slicing, to let the juices settle.</li>    
    <li>Garnish the matambre a la pizza with oregano to serve (if desired). Serve with roasted (or grilled) potatoes and grilled bread.</li>
</ol>
